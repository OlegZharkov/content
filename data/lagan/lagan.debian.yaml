description: Lagan takes local alignments generated by CHAOS as anchors, and limits
  the search area of the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm around these anchors. . Multi-LAGAN
  is a generalization of the pairwise algorithm to multiple sequence alignment. M-LAGAN
  performs progressive pairwise alignments, guided by a user-specified phylogenetic
  tree. Alignments are aligned to other alignments using the sum-of-pairs metric.
