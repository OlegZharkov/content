description: 'MacSyFinder is a program to model and detect macromolecular systems,
  genetic pathways... in protein datasets. In prokaryotes, these systems have often
  evolutionarily conserved properties: they are made of conserved components, and
  are encoded in compact loci (conserved genetic architecture). The user models these
  systems with MacSyFinder to reflect these conserved features, and to allow their
  efficient detection . This package presents the Open Source Java API to biological
  databases and a series of mostly sequence-based algorithms.'
