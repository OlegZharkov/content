description: 'Stacks is a software pipeline for building loci from short-read sequences,
  such as those generated on the Illumina platform. Stacks was developed to work with
  restriction enzyme-based data, such as RAD-seq, for the purpose of building genetic
  maps and conducting population genomics and phylogeography. . Note that this package
  installs Stacks such that all commands must be run as: $ stacks <cmdname> <args>'
