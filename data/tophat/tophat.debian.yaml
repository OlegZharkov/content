description: TopHat aligns RNA-Seq reads to mammalian-sized genomes using the ultra
  high-throughput short read aligner Bowtie, and then analyzes the mapping results
  to identify splice junctions between exons. TopHat is a collaborative effort between
  the University of Maryland Center for Bioinformatics and Computational Biology and
  the University of California, Berkeley Departments of Mathematics and Molecular
  and Cell Biology.
