description: The abundance of transcripts in a human tissue sample can be determined
  by RNA sequencing. The exact sequence sampled may be random, depending on the technology
  used. And it may be short, i.e. shorter than the transcript. At some point, many
  shorter reads need to be assembled to the model the complete transcripts. . StringTie
  knows how to assemble of RNA-Seq into potential transcripts without the need of
  a reference genome and provides a quantification also of the splice variants.
