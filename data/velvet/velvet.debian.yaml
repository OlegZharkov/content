description: Velvet is a de novo genomic assembler specially designed for short read
  sequencing technologies, such as Solexa or 454, developed by Daniel Zerbino and
  Ewan Birney at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), near Cambridge,
  in the United Kingdom. . Velvet currently takes in short read sequences, removes
  errors then produces high quality unique contigs. It then uses paired read information,
  if available, to retrieve the repeated areas between contigs.
