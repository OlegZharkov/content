description: 'SPARTA is a workflow aimed at analyzing single-end Illumina RNA-seq
  data. The workflow combines several tools: Trimmomatic (read trimming/adapter removal),
  FastQC (read quality analysis), Bowtie (mapping reads to the reference genome),
  HTSeq (transcript/gene feature abundance counting), and edgeR (differential gene
  expression analysis). Within the differential gene expression analysis step, batch
  effects can be detected and the user is warned of the potential, unintended additional
  variable. The analysis procedure is outlined below.'
