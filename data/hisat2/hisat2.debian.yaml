description: HISAT2 is a fast and sensitive alignment program for mapping next-generation
  sequencing reads (both DNA and RNA) to a population of human genomes (as well as
  against a single reference genome). Based on an extension of BWT for graphs a graph
  FM index (GFM) was designed and implementd. In addition to using one global GFM
  index that represents a population of human genomes, HISAT2 uses a large set of
  small GFM indexes that collectively cover the whole genome (each index representing
  a genomic region of 56 Kbp, with 55,000 indexes needed to cover the human population).
  These small indexes (called local indexes), combined with several alignment strategies,
  enable rapid and accurate alignment of sequencing reads. This new indexing scheme
  is called a Hierarchical Graph FM index (HGFM).
