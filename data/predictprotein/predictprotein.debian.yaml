description: 'PredictProtein is a sequence analysis suite providing prediction of
  protein structure and function. . PredictProtein takes a protein sequence as input
  and provides the following per-residue, or whole protein annotations: * secondary
  structure * solvent accessibility * multiple sequence alignments * PROSITE sequence
  motifs * low-complexity regions * nuclear localisation signals * regions lacking
  regular structure (NORS) * unstructured loops * transmembrane helices * transmembrane
  beta barrels * coiled-coil regions * disulfide-bonds * disordered regions * B-value
  flexibility * protein-protein interaction sites * Gene Ontology terms'
