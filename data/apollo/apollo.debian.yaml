description: Apollo is a genome annotation viewer and editor. It was developed as
  a collaboration between the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project (part of the FlyBase
  consortium) and The Sanger Institute in Cambridge, UK. Apollo allows researchers
  to explore genomic annotations at many levels of detail, and to perform expert annotation
  curation, all in a graphical environment. It was used by the FlyBase biologists
  to construct the Release 3 annotations on the finished Drosophila melanogaster genome,
  and is also a primary vehicle for sharing these annotations with the community.
  The Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project, which aims to provide a complete
  ready-to-use toolkit for analyzing whole genomes, has adopted Apollo as its annotation
  workbench.
