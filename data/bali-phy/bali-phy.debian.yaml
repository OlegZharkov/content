description: BAli-Phy estimates multiple sequence alignments and evolutionary trees
  from unaligned DNA, amino acid, or codon sequences. BAli-Phy uses MCMC to estimate
  evolutionary trees, positive selection, and branch lengths while averaging over
  alternative alignments. BAli-Phy can display alignment ambiguity graphically in
  an alignment uncertainty (AU) plot. . BAli-Phy can also estimate phylogenies from
  a fixed alignment (like MrBayes and BEAST) using substitution models like GTR+gamma.
  BAli-Phy automatically estimates relative rates for each gene.
