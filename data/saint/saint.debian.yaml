description: SAINT implements the scoring algorithm for protein-protein interaction
  data using label free quantitative proteomics data in AP-MS experiments. It was
  used for spectral count data in the yeast kinase interactome work not incorporating
  control purification, as well as a generalized implementation for spectral count
  data with and without control purification. . Alternatively, you can also run SAINT
  in combination with ProHits. . The package was written for either doing analysis
  without or with control IPs and
