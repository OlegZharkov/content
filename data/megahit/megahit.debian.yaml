description: 'Megahit is an ultra-fast and memory-efficient NGS assembler. It is optimized
  for metagenomes, but also works well on generic single genome assembly (small or
  mammalian size) and single-cell assembly. . The software was praised in a Briefings
  in Bioinformatics 5/2020 review (DOI: 10.1093/bib/bbaa085).'
