description: vt is a variant tool set that discovers short variants from Next Generation
  Sequencing data. . Vt-normalize is a tool to normalize representation of genetic
  variants in the VCF. Variant normalization is formally defined as the consistent
  representation of genetic variants in an unambiguous and concise way. In vt a simple
  general algorithm to enforce this is implemented.
