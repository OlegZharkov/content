description: GenomeThreader is a software tool to compute gene structure predictions.
  The gene structure predictions are calculated using a similarity-based approach
  where additional cDNA/EST and/or protein sequences are used to predict gene structures
  via spliced alignments. GenomeThreader was motivated by disabling limitations in
  GeneSeqer, a popular gene prediction program which is widely used for plant genome
  annotation.
