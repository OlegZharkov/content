description: Crossbow is a scalable software pipeline for whole genome resequencing
  analysis. It combines Bowtie, an ultrafast and memory efficient short read aligner,
  and SoapSNP, an accurate genotyper, within Hadoop to distribute and accelerate the
  computation with many nodes. The pipeline can accurately analyze over 35x coverage
  of a human genome in one day on a 10-node local cluster, or in 3 hours for about
  $100 using a 40-node, 320-core cluster rented from Amazon's EC2 utility computing
  service.
