description: The major goal of SGA is to be very memory efficient, which is achieved
  by using a compressed representation of DNA sequence reads. . SGA is a de novo assembler
  for DNA sequence reads. It is based on Gene Myers' string graph formulation of assembly
  and uses the FM-index/Burrows-Wheeler transform to efficiently find overlaps between
  sequence reads.
