description: 'PacBio DNA sequencers produce two types of characteristic reads: CCS
  (short and low error rate) and CLR (long and high error rate), both of which could
  be useful for de novo assembly of genomes. PBSIM simulates those PacBio reads from
  a reference sequence by using either a model-based or sampling-based simulation.
  Simulated reads are useful, for example, when developing or evaluating sequence
  assemblers targeted at PacBio data.'
