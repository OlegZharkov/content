description: SINA is a tool to add sequences to an existing multiple sequence alignment.
  It needs about 1 second on a single core to add one 16S full length sequence (about
  100k/h on a 32-core workstation). It was developed to create the multi-million sequence
  alignment that is the core of the SILVA SSU and LSU rRNA databases.
