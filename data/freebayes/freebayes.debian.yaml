description: FreeBayes is a Bayesian genetic variant detector designed to find small
  polymorphisms, specifically SNPs (single-nucleotide polymorphisms), indels (insertions
  and deletions), MNPs (multi-nucleotide polymorphisms), and complex events (composite
  insertion and substitution events) smaller than the length of a short-read sequencing
  alignment.
