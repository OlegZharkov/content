description: The Nanopore is a device to determine the sequences of single moleculres
  of DNA. No amplification. The output is gigantic and tools like this one help to
  reduce it. . Over time, other means have substitute the need for this one. Upstream
  has halted development. Some tutorials and pipelines of the Nanopore still refer
  to it, though.
