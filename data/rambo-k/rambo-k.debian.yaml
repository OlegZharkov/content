description: RAMBO-K is a tool for rapid and sensitive removal of background sequences
  from Next Generation Sequencing data. . RAMBO-K is a reference-based tool for rapid
  and sensitive extraction of one organisms reads from a mixed dataset. It is based
  on a Markov chain implementation, which uses genomic characteristics of each reference
  to assign reads to the associated set.
