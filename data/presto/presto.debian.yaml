description: pRESTO is a toolkit for processing raw reads from high-throughput sequencing
  of B cell and T cell repertoires. . Dramatic improvements in high-throughput sequencing
  technologies now enable large-scale characterization of lymphocyte repertoires,
  defined as the collection of trans-membrane antigen-receptor proteins located on
  the surface of B cells and T cells. The REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) is
  composed of a suite of utilities to handle all stages of sequence processing prior
  to germline segment assignment. pRESTO is designed to handle either single reads
  or paired-end reads. It includes features for quality control, primer masking, annotation
  of reads with sequence embedded barcodes, generation of unique molecular identifier
  (UMI) consensus sequences, assembly of paired-end reads and identification of duplicate
  sequences. Numerous options for sequence sorting, sampling and conversion operations
  are also included.
