description: PAL2NAL is a program that converts a multiple sequence alignment of proteins
  and the corresponding DNA (or mRNA) sequences into a codon-based DNA alignment.
  The program automatically assigns the corresponding codon sequence even if the input
  DNA sequence has mismatches with the input protein sequence, or contains UTRs, polyA
  tails. It can also deal with frame shifts in the input alignment, which is suitable
  for the analysis of pseudogenes. The resulting codon-based DNA alignment can further
  be subjected to the calculation of synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) substitution
  rates.
