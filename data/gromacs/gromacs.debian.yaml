description: GROMACS is a versatile package to perform molecular dynamics, i.e. simulate
  the Newtonian equations of motion for systems with hundreds to millions of particles.
  . It is primarily designed for biochemical molecules like proteins and lipids that
  have a lot of complicated bonded interactions, but since GROMACS is extremely fast
  at calculating the nonbonded interactions (that usually dominate simulations) many
  groups are also using it for research on non- biological systems, e.g. polymers.
