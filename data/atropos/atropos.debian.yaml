description: 'Atropos is tool for specific, sensitive, and speedy trimming of NGS
  reads. It is a fork of the venerable Cutadapt read trimmer, with the primary improvements
  being: . 1. Multi-threading support, including an extremely fast "parallel write"
  mode. 2. Implementation of a new insert alignment-based trimming algorithm for paired-end
  reads that is substantially more sensitive and specific than the original Cutadapt
  adapter alignment-based algorithm. This algorithm can also correct mismatches between
  the overlapping portions of the reads. 3. Options for trimming specific types of
  data (miRNA, bisulfite-seq). 4. A new command (''detect'') that will detect adapter
  sequences and other potential contaminants. 5. A new command (''error'') that will
  estimate the sequencing error rate, which helps to select the appropriate adapter-
  and quality- trimming parameter values. 6. A new command (''qc'') that generates
  read statistics similar to FastQC. The trim command can also compute read statistics
  both before and after trimming (using the ''--stats'' option). 7. Improved summary
  reports, including support for serialization formats (JSON, YAML, pickle), support
  for user-defined templates (via the optional Jinja2 dependency), and integration
  with MultiQC. 8. The ability to merge overlapping reads (this is experimental and
  the functionality is limited). 9. The ability to write the summary report and log
  messages to separate files. 10. The ability to read SAM/BAM files and read/write
  interleaved FASTQ files. 11. Direct trimming of reads from an SRA accession. 12.
  A progress bar, and other minor usability enhancements.'
