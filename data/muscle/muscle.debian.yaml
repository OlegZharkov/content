description: MUSCLE is a multiple alignment program for protein sequences. MUSCLE
  stands for multiple sequence comparison by log-expectation. In the authors tests,
  MUSCLE achieved the highest scores of all tested programs on several alignment accuracy
  benchmarks, and is also one of the fastest programs out there.
