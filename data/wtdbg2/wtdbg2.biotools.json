It assembles raw reads without error correction and then builds the consensus from intermediate assembly output. Wtdbg2 is able to assemble the human and even the 32Gb Axolotl genome at a speed tens of times faster than CANU and FALCON while producing contigs of comparable base accuracy.\n\n||| CORRECT NAME OF TOOL COULD ALSO BE 'wtdbg2 2-17'",

We developed a long-read assembler wtdbg2 (https://github.com/ruanjue/wtdbg2) that is 2\u201317 times as fast as published tools while achieving comparable contiguity and accuracy. It paves the way for population-scale long-read assembly in future.",
