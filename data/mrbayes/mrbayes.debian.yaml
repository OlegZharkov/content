description: Bayesian inference of phylogeny is based upon a quantity called the posterior
  probability distribution of trees, which is the probability of a tree conditioned
  on the observations. The conditioning is accomplished using Bayes's theorem. The
  posterior probability distribution of trees is impossible to calculate analytically;
  instead, MrBayes uses a simulation technique called Markov chain Monte Carlo (or
  MCMC) to approximate the posterior probabilities of trees.
