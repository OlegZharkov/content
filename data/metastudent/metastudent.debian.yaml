description: Often, only the sequence of a protein is known, but not its functions.
  Metastudent will try to predict missing functional annotations through homology
  searches (BLAST). . All predicted functions correspond to Gene Ontology (GO) terms
  from the Molecular Function Ontology (MFO) and the Biological Process Ontology (BPO)
  and are associated with a reliability score. . This package contains data files
  for metastudent.
