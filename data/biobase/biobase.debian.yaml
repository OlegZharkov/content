description: Biobase is part of the Bioconductor project, and is used by many other
  packages. Biobase contains standardized data structures to represent genomic data,
  and functions that are needed by many other packages or which replace R functions.
  . Bioconductor is a project to develop innovative software tools for use in computational
  biology. It is based on the R language. You should already be quite familiar with
  R before using Bioconductor. Bioconductor packages provide flexible interactive
  tools for carrying out a number of different computational tasks.
