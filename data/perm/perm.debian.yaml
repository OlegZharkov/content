description: PerM is a software package which was designed to perform highly efficient
  genome scale alignments for hundreds of millions of short reads produced by the
  ABI SOLiD and Illumina sequencing platforms. Today PerM is capable of providing
  full sensitivity for alignments within 4 mismatches for 50bp SOLID reads and 9 mismatches
  for 100bp Illumina reads.
