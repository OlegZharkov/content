  factor binding sites. It includes matrices conversion between Position Frequency
  Matirx (PFM), Position Weight Matirx (PWM) and Information Content Matrix (ICM).
  It can also scan putative TFBS from sequence/alignment, query JASPAR database and
  provides a wrapper of de novo motif discovery software.
