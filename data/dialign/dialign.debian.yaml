description: DIALIGN2 is a command line tool to perform multiple alignment of protein
  or DNA sequences. It constructs alignments from gapfree pairs of similar segments
  of the sequences. This scoring scheme for alignments is the basic difference between
  DIALIGN and other global or local alignment methods. Note that DIALIGN does not
  employ any kind of gap penalty.
