description: EMBOSS is a free Open Source software analysis package specially developed
  for the needs of the molecular biology (e.g. EMBnet) user community. The software
  automatically copes with data in a variety of formats and even allows transparent
  retrieval of sequence data from the web. Also, as extensive libraries are provided
  with the package, it is a platform to allow other scientists to develop and release
  software in true open source spirit. EMBOSS also integrates a range of currently
  available packages and tools for sequence analysis into a seamless whole. EMBOSS
  breaks the historical trend towards commercial software packages.
