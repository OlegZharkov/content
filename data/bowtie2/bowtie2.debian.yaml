description: 'is an ultrafast and memory-efficient tool for aligning sequencing reads
  to long reference sequences. It is particularly good at aligning reads of about
  50 up to 100s or 1,000s of characters, and particularly good at aligning to relatively
  long (e.g. mammalian) genomes. . Bowtie 2 indexes the genome with an FM Index to
  keep its memory footprint small: for the human genome, its memory footprint is typically
  around 3.2 GB. Bowtie 2 supports gapped, local, and paired-end alignment modes'
