description: This is the andi program for estimating the evolutionary distance between
  closely related genomes. These distances can be used to rapidly infer phylogenies
  for big sets of genomes. Because andi does not compute full alignments, it is so
  efficient that it scales even up to thousands of bacterial genomes.
