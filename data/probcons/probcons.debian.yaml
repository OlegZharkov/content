description: Tool for generating multiple alignments of protein sequences. Using a
  combination of probabilistic modeling and consistency-based alignment techniques,
  PROBCONS has achieved the highest accuracies of all alignment methods to date. On
  the BAliBASE benchmark alignment database, alignments produced by PROBCONS show
  statistically significant improvement over current programs, containing an average
  of 7% more correctly aligned columns than those of T-Coffee, 11% more correctly
  aligned columns than those of CLUSTAL W, and 14% more correctly aligned columns
  than those of DIALIGN.
