description: Cufflinks assembles transcripts, estimates their abundances, and tests
  for differential expression and regulation in RNA-Seq samples. It accepts aligned
  RNA-Seq reads and assembles the alignments into a parsimonious set of transcripts.
  Cufflinks then estimates the relative abundances of these transcripts based on how
  many reads support each one.
