description: 'Sibelia (Synteny Block ExpLoration tool) is a comparative genomics tool:
  It assists biologists in analysing the genomic variations that correlate with pathogens,
  or the genomic changes that help microorganisms adapt in different environments.
  Sibelia will also be helpful for the evolutionary and genome rearrangement studies
  for multiple strains of microorganisms. . Sibelia is useful in finding: . 1) shared
  regions, 2) regions that present in one group of genomes but not in others, 3) rearrangements
  that transform one genome to other genomes.'
