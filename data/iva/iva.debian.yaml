description: IVA is a de novo assembler designed to assemble virus genomes that have
  no repeat sequences, using Illumina read pairs sequenced from mixed populations
  at extremely high depth. . IVA's main algorithm works by iteratively extending contigs
  using aligned read pairs. Its input can be just read pairs, or additionally you
  can provide an existing set of contigs to be extended. Alternatively, it can take
  reads together with a reference sequence.
