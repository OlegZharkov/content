description: 'The Protein-Ligand Interaction Profiler (PLIP) is a tool to analyze
  and visualize protein-ligand interactions in PDB files. . Features include: * Detection
  of eight different types of noncovalent interactions * Automatic detection of relevant
  ligands in a PDB file * Direct download of PDB structures from wwPDB server if valid
  PDB ID is given * Processing of custom PDB files containing protein-ligand complexes
  (e.g. from docking) * No need for special preparation of a PDB file, works out of
  the box * Atom-level interaction reports in rST and XML formats for easy parsing
  * Generation of PyMOL session files (.pse) for each pairing, enabling easy preparation
  of images for publications and talks * Rendering of preview image for each ligand
  and its interactions with the protein'
