description: 'Trimmomatic performs a variety of useful trimming tasks for illumina
  paired-end and single ended data.The selection of trimming steps and their associated
  parameters are supplied on the command line. . The current trimming steps are: *
  ILLUMINACLIP: Cut adapter and other illumina-specific sequences from the read. *
  SLIDINGWINDOW: Perform a sliding window trimming, cutting once thes average quality
  within the window falls below a threshold. * LEADING: Cut bases off the start of
  a read, if below a threshold quality * TRAILING: Cut bases off the end of a read,
  if below a threshold quality * CROP: Cut the read to a specified length * HEADCROP:
  Cut the specified number of bases from the start of the read * MINLENGTH: Drop the
  read if it is below a specified length * TOPHRED33: Convert quality scores to Phred-33
  * TOPHRED64: Convert quality scores to Phred-64 It works with FASTQ (using phred
  + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores, depending on the Illumina pipeline used), either
  uncompressed or gzipp''ed FASTQ. Use of gzip format is determined based on the .gz
  extension.'
