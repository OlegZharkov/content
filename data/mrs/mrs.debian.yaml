description: MRS is a complete system to retrieve, index and query biological and
  medical databanks. It comes with all the code required to fetch data using FTP or
  rsync, then creates a local databank with indices using a databank specific parser
  written in Perl. It can then serve this data using a built-in web application and
  webservices. . Searching can be done on words and Boolean queries. As a bonus you
  can search protein sequences using a custom Blast algorithm.
