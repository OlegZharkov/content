description: "MAFFT is a multiple sequence alignment program which offers three accuracy-oriented\
  \ methods: * L-INS-i (probably most accurate; recommended for <200 sequences; iterative\
  \ refinement method incorporating local pairwise alignment information), * G-INS-i\
  \ (suitable for sequences of similar lengths; recommended for <200 sequences; iterative\
  \ refinement method incorporating global pairwise alignment information), * E-INS-i\
  \ (suitable for sequences containing large unalignable regions; recommended for\
  \ <200 sequences), and five speed-oriented methods: * FFT-NS-i (iterative refinement\
  \ method; two cycles only), * FFT-NS-i (iterative refinement method; max. 1000 iterations),\
  \ * FFT-NS-2 (fast; progressive method), * FFT-NS-1 (very fast; recommended for\
  \ >2000 sequences; progressive method with a rough guide tree), * NW-NS-PartTree-1\
  \ (recommended for \u223C50,000 sequences; progressive method with the PartTree\
  \ algorithm)."
