description: 'Flye is a de novo assembler for single molecule sequencing reads, such
  as those produced by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore Technologies. It is designed for
  a wide range of datasets, from small bacterial projects to large mammalian-scale
  assemblies. The package represents a complete pipeline: it takes raw PacBio / ONT
  reads as input and outputs polished contigs. Flye also has a special mode for metagenome
  assembly.'
