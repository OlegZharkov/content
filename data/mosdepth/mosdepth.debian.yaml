description: 'Many small reads are produced by high-throughput "next generation" sequencing
  technologies. The final sequence is derived from how these reads are overlapping
  towards a consensus. The more reads are covering/confirming parts of a nucleotide
  seq, the higher the confidence is. Too many reads would be indicative of e.g. repeats
  in the genome. . mosdepth can output: * per-base depth about 2x as fast samtools
  depth--about 25 minutes of CPU time for a 30X genome. * mean per-window depth given
  a window size--as would be used for CNV calling. * the mean per-region given a BED
  file of regions. * a distribution of proportion of bases covered at or above a given
  threshold for each chromosome and genome-wide. * quantized output that merges adjacent
  bases as long as they fall in the same coverage bins e.g. (10-20) * threshold output
  to indicate how many bases in each region are covered at the given thresholds. when
  appropriate, the output files are bgzipped and indexed for ease of use.'
