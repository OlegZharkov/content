description: 'RepeatMasker is a program that screens DNA sequences for interspersed
  repeats and low complexity DNA sequences. The output of the program is a detailed
  annotation of the repeats that are present in the query sequence as well as a modified
  version of the query sequence in which all the annotated repeats have been masked
  (default: replaced by Ns). Sequence comparisons in RepeatMasker are performed by
  the program cross_match, an efficient implementation of the Smith-Waterman-Gotoh
  algorithm developed by Phil Green, or by WU-Blast developed by Warren Gish.'
