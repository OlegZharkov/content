description: 'The objectif of the THESIAS program is to performed haplotype-based
  association analysis in unrelated individuals. This program is based on the maximum
  likelihood model described in Tregouet et al. 2002 (Hum Mol Genet 2002,11: 2015-2023)
  and is linked to the SEM algorithm (Tregouet et al. Ann Hum Genet 2004,68: 165-177).
  THESIAS allows one to simultaneous estimate haplotype frequencies and their associate
  effects on the phenotype of interest. In this new THESIAS release, quantitative,
  qualitative (logistic and matched-pair analysis), categorical and survival outcomes
  can be studied. X-linked haplotype analysis is also feasible. Covariate-adjusted
  haplotype effects as well as haplotype x covariate interactions can also be investigated.'
