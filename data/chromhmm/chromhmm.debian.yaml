description: ChromHMM is software for learning and characterizing chromatin states.
  ChromHMM can integrate multiple chromatin datasets such as ChIP-seq data of various
  histone modifications to discover de novo the major re-occuring combinatorial and
  spatial patterns of marks. ChromHMM is based on a multivariate Hidden Markov Model
  that explicitly models the presence or absence of each chromatin mark. The resulting
  model can then be used to systematically annotate a genome in one or more cell types.
  By automatically computing state enrichments for large-scale functional and annotation
  datasets ChromHMM facilitates the biological characterization of each state. ChromHMM
  also produces files with genome-wide maps of chromatin state annotations that can
  be directly visualized in a genome browser.
