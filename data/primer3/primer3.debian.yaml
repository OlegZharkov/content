description: Primer3 picks primers for Polymerase Chain Reactions (PCRs), considering
  as criteria oligonucleotide melting temperature, size, GC content and primer-dimer
  possibilities, PCR product size, positional constraints within the source sequence,
  and miscellaneous other constraints. All of these criteria are user-specifiable
  as constraints, and some are specifiable as terms in an objective function that
  characterizes an optimal primer pair.
