description: MEME (Multiple EM for Motif Elicitation) is a tool for discovering motifs
  in a group of related DNA or protein sequences. A motif is a sequence pattern that
  occurs repeatedly in a group of related protein or DNA sequences. MEME represents
  motifs as position-dependent letter-probability matrices which describe the probability
  of each possible letter at each position in the pattern. Individual MEME motifs
  do not contain gaps. Patterns with variable-length gaps are split by MEME into two
  or more separate motifs. . MEME takes as input a group of DNA or protein sequences
  (the training set) and outputs as many motifs as requested. MEME uses statistical
  modeling techniques to automatically choose the best width, number of occurrences,
  and description for each motif.
