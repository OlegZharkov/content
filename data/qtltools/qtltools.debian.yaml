description: QTLtools is a tool set for molecular Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) discovery
  and analysis. It allows user to go from the raw sequence data to collection of molecular
  QTL in few easy-to-perform steps. QTLtools contains multiple methods to prepare
  the data, to discover proximal and distal molecular QTL and to finally integrate
  them with GWAS variants and functional annotations of the genome.
