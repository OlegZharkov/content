description: 'Avogadro is a molecular graphics and modelling system targeted at molecules
  and biomolecules. It can visualize properties like molecular orbitals or electrostatic
  potentials and features an intuitive molecular builder. . Features include: * Molecular
  modeller with automatic force-field based geometry optimization * Molecular Mechanics
  including constraints and conformer searches * Visualization of molecular orbitals
  and general isosurfaces * Visualization of vibrations and plotting of vibrational
  spectra * Support for crystallographic unit cells * Input generation for the Gaussian,
  GAMESS and MOLPRO quantum chemistry packages * Flexible plugin architecture and
  Python scripting . File formats Avogadro can read include PDB, XYZ, CML, CIF, Molden,
  as well as Gaussian, GAMESS and MOLPRO output.'
