description: SSAKE-based Scaffolding of Pre-Assembled Contigs after Extension (SSPACE)
  is a script able to extend and scaffold pre-assembled contigs using one or more
  mate pairs or paired-end libraries, or even a combination. . SSPACE is built based
  on SSAKE. Code of SSAKE is changed to be able to extend and scaffold pre-assembled
  contigs for multiple paired reads libraries. . This is the free 'basic' version
  of SSPACE. The non-free 'standard' version is available directly from Baseclear.
