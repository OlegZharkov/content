description: "The Short Sequence Assembly by K-mer search and 3\u2032 read Extension\
  \ (SSAKE) is a genomics application for aggressively assembling millions of short\
  \ nucleotide sequences by progressively searching for perfect 3\u2032-most k-mers\
  \ using a DNA prefix tree. SSAKE is designed to help leverage the information from\
  \ short sequences reads by stringently clustering them into contigs that can be\
  \ used to characterize novel sequencing targets."
