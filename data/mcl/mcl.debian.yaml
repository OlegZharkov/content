description: The MCL package is an implementation of the MCL algorithm, and offers
  utilities for manipulating sparse matrices (the essential data structure in the
  MCL algorithm) and conducting cluster experiments. . MCL is currently being used
  in sciences like biology (protein family detection, genomics), computer science
  (node clustering in Peer-to-Peer networks), and linguistics (text analysis).
