description: SeaView is a viewer and editor of multiple sequence alignments, i.e.
  DNA or protein sequences are positioned each in their own separate line, such that
  the nucleotide/amino acid at a particular position (column) is presumed to have
  the same biochemical property. . SeaView reads and writes various file formats (NEXUS,
  MSF, CLUSTAL, FASTA, PHYLIP, MASE, Newick) of DNA and protein sequences and of phylogenetic
  trees. Alignments can be manually edited. It drives the programs Muscle or Clustal
  Omega for multiple sequence alignment, and also allows one to use any external alignment
  algorithm able to read and write FASTA-formatted files. It computes phylogenetic
  trees by parsimony using PHYLIP's dnapars/protpars algorithm, by distance with NJ
  or BioNJ algorithms on a variety of evolutionary distances, or by maximum likelihood
  using the program PhyML 3.0. . SeaView draws phylogenetic trees on screen or PostScript
  files, and allows one to download sequences from EMBL/GenBank/UniProt using the
  Internet.
