description: 'This program computes, for a nucleic acid duplex, the enthalpy, the
  entropy and the melting temperature of the helix-coil transitions. Three types of
  hybridisation are possible: DNA/DNA, DNA/RNA, and RNA/RNA. The program first computes
  the hybridisation enthalpy and entropy from the elementary parameters of each Crick''s
  pair by the nearest-neighbor method. Then the melting temperature is computed. The
  set of thermodynamic parameters can be easily changed, for instance following an
  experimental breakthrough.'
