description: RNAhybrid is a tool for finding the minimum free energy hybridisation
  of a long and a short RNA. The hybridisation is performed in a kind of domain mode,
  ie. The short sequence is hybridised to the best fitting part of the long one. The
  tool is primarily meant as a means for microRNA target prediction.
