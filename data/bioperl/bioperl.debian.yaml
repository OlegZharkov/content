description: The Bioperl project is a coordinated effort to collect computational
  methods routinely used in bioinformatics into a set of standard CPAN-style, well-documented,
  and freely available Perl modules. It is well-accepted throughout the community
  and used in many high-profile projects, e.g., Ensembl. . The recommended packages
  are needed to run some of the included binaries, for a detailed explanation including
  the specific Perl modules please see README.Debian. . The suggested package enhances
  the manual pages.
