    "description": "A Random Generator of Computational Phantoms for Bone Marrow Dosimetry.\n\nThis study was motivated by the efforts to evaluate radiation risk for leukemia incidence in the Techa River cohort, where the main bone marrow dose contributors were Sr (bone-seeking beta emitters). Energy deposition in bone marrow targets was evaluated by simulating radiation particle transport using computational phantoms. The present paper describes the computer program Trabecula implementing an algorithm for parametric generation of computational phantoms, which serve as the basis for calculating bone marrow doses. Trabecula is a user-friendly tool that automatically converts analytical models into voxelized representations that are directly compatible as input to Monte Carlo N Particle code.",
