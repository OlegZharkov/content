description: "The SPAdes \u2013 St. Petersburg genome assembler is intended for both\
  \ standard isolates and single-cell MDA bacteria assemblies. It works with Illumina\
  \ or IonTorrent reads and is capable of providing hybrid assemblies using PacBio\
  \ and Sanger reads. You can also provide additional contigs that will be used as\
  \ long reads."
