description: tRNAscan-SE identifies 99-100% of transfer RNA genes in DNA sequence
  while giving less than one false positive per 15 gigabases. Two previously described
  tRNA detection programs are used as fast, first-pass prefilters to identify candidate
  tRNAs, which are then analyzed by a highly selective tRNA covariance model. This
  work represents a practical application of RNA covariance models, which are general,
  probabilistic secondary structure profiles based on stochastic context-free grammars.
  tRNAscan-SE searches at ~ 30 000 bp/s. Additional extensions to tRNAscan-SE detect
  unusual tRNA homologues such as selenocysteine tRNAs, tRNA-derived repetitive elements
  and tRNA pseudogenes.
