description: SOAPdenovo is a novel short-read assembly method that can build a de
  novo draft assembly for the human-sized genomes. The program is specially designed
  to assemble Illumina GA short reads. . It creates new opportunities for building
  reference sequences and carrying out accurate analyses of unexplored genomes in
  a cost effective way.
