description: MACS empirically models the length of the sequenced ChIP fragments, which
  tends to be shorter than sonication or library construction size estimates, and
  uses it to improve the spatial resolution of predicted binding sites. MACS also
  uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to effectively capture local biases in the genome
  sequence, allowing for more sensitive and robust prediction. MACS compares favorably
  to existing ChIP-Seq peak-finding algorithms, is publicly available open source,
  and can be used for ChIP-Seq with or without control samples.
