description: Salmon is a wicked-fast program to produce a highly-accurate, transcript-level
  quantification estimates from RNA-seq data. Salmon achieves is accuracy and speed
  via a number of different innovations, including the use of lightweight alignments
  (accurate but fast-to-compute proxies for traditional read alignments) and massively-parallel
  stochastic collapsed variational inference. The result is a versatile tool that
  fits nicely into many different pipelines. For example, you can choose to make use
  of the lightweight alignments by providing Salmon with raw sequencing reads, or,
  if it is more convenient, you can provide Salmon with regular alignments (e.g. computed
  with your favorite aligner), and it will use the same wicked-fast, state-of-the-art
  inference algorithm to estimate transcript-level abundances for your experiment.
