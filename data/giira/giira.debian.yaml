description: GIIRA is a gene prediction method that identifies potential coding regions
  exclusively based on the mapping of reads from an RNA-Seq experiment. It was foremost
  designed for prokaryotic gene prediction and is able to resolve genes within the
  expressed region of an operon. However, it is also applicable to eukaryotes and
  predicts exon intron structures as well as alternative isoforms.
