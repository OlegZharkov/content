description: 'Bismark is a program to map bisulfite treated sequencing reads to a
  genome of interest and perform methylation calls in a single step. The output can
  be easily imported into a genome viewer, such as SeqMonk, and enables a researcher
  to analyse the methylation levels of their samples straight away. It''s main features
  are: . * Bisulfite mapping and methylation calling in one single step * Supports
  single-end and paired-end read alignments * Supports ungapped and gapped alignments
  * Alignment seed length, number of mismatches etc. are adjustable * Output discriminates
  between cytosine methylation in CpG, CHG and CHH context'
