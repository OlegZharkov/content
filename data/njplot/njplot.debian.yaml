description: NJplot is able to draw any dendrogram expressed in the Newick standard
  phylogenetic tree format (e.g., the format used by the Phylip package). NJplot is
  especially convenient for rooting the unrooted trees obtained from parsimony, distance
  or maximum likelihood tree-building methods.
