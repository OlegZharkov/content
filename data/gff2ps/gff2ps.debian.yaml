description: gff2ps is a script program developed with the aim of converting gff-formatted
  records into high quality one-dimensional plots in PostScript. Such plots maybe
  useful for comparing genomic structures and to visualizing outputs from genome annotation
  programs. It can be used in a very simple way, because it assumes that the GFF file
  itself carries enough formatting information, but it also allows through a number
  of options and/or a configuration file, for a great degree of customization.
