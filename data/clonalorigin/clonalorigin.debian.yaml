description: Bacteria, unlike us, can reproduce on their own. They do however have
  mechanisms that transfer DNA between organisms, a process more formally known as
  recombination. The mechanisms by which recombination takes place have been studied
  extensively in the laboratory but much remains to be understood concerning how,
  when and where recombination takes place within natural populations of bacteria
  and how it helps them to adapt to new environments. ClonalOrigin performs a comparative
  analysis of the sequences of a sample of bacterial genomes in order to reconstruct
  the recombination events that have taken place in their ancestry.
