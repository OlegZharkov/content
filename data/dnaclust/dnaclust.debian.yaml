description: dnaclust is a tool for clustering large number of short DNA sequences.
  The clusters are created in such a way that the "radius" of each clusters is no
  more than the specified threshold. . The input sequences to be clustered should
  be in Fasta format. The id of each sequence is based on the first word of the seqeunce
  in the Fasta format. The first word is the prefix of the header up to the first
  occurrence of white space characters in the header.
